Querying and ERD Design on Airlines Data
----------------

This is a simple SQL project that showcases querying on an airlines dataset.  It showcases queries such as select statement variations, inserting and removing data, manipulating records in tables, join statements, ordering and grouping, variable creation, filtering, and querying by date.  The project contains 10 problems, which are all included in the file "Airlines Querying Exercise.xlsx".

The project also involves the design of relational databases through Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD).  I used ER Assistant to create an ERD mapping the relationships between tables in the airlines database.  The ERD includes identification of primary and foreign keys, as well as descriptions of the relationships between each table.  This diagram can be found in the file "Problem 1 ERD.erd".  An image of the diagram is included in the main Excel file inside the "Problem 1" tab.

The final component of this project is a memo describing the pros and cons of using relational databases over a flat file format.  The memo is included in the main Excel file inside the "Problem 10" tab.  It is also attached separately in the file "Problem 10 Memo.pdf".

The airlines dataset used in this project was provided by my course instructor through Virtual Machine at the University of Maryland University College.  The data files are not available outside of the MySQL installation provided by the course's Virtual Machine server.

The SQL script is included in the file "DSA-Assignment 3.1.sql".  The requirements are described in the file "requirements.txt".  Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the R file.  After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.
